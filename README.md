# ðŸ”´ PokÃ©mon Ga OlÃ©-inspired OOP Console Game âšª
This is a simple Java console-based game inspired by the PokÃ©mon Ga OlÃ© arcade game. The program focuses on the classic Battle and Catch mode, featuring a streamlined gameplay loop with three PokÃ©mon types: Grass, Water, and Fire. All interactions take place directly in the IDE console; no GUI is implemented.

## Key Features
1. **Random PokÃ©mon Generation:** Generate a random set of PokÃ©mon to battle against
2. **PokÃ©mon Info Display:** View stats and details of available PokÃ©mon
3. **Catching Mechanism:** Attempt to catch defeated PokÃ©mon and add them to your collection
4. **Battle System:** Choose your PokÃ©mon to battle opponents using simple type-advantage rules
5. **Data Persistence:** Save caught PokÃ©mon to an external `.txt` file for later reference
6. **Leaderboard:** Calculate and display battle scores to track player progress

## Concepts Used
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and modularity
- **File I/O:** Read and write operations with `.txt` files for saving and loading PokÃ©mon data
- **Game Loop & State Management:** Structured gameplay flow with turn-based logic
- **Basic Arithmetic Logic:** Used for score calculations and battle outcomes

## Limitations & Future Enhancements
### Limitations
- Only three PokÃ©mon types (Grass, Water, Fire) are supported
- Battles use simple type-advantage rules (no advanced mechanics)
- Text-based interface only â€” no GUI or animations
- PokÃ©mon stats and moves are kept basic for simplicity

### Future Enhancements
- Expand the roster to include more PokÃ©mon types
- Add more complex battle mechanics (HP, movesets, status effects)
- Implement a GUI for a more interactive experience
- Introduce multiplayer or AI difficulty scaling
- Enhance leaderboard with player profiles and session history
