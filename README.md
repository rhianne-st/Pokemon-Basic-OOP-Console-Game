# ðŸ”´ PokÃ©mon Ga OlÃ©-inspired OOP Console Game âšª
This is a simple Java console program of the '*PokÃ©mon Ga OlÃ©*' arcade game. No GUI is implemented here, all gameplay is carried out through the IDE's console.
<br>TO NOTE: This project is built for an *Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals* school assignment using **Eclipse IDE** within a 6-week timeline.

## Project Scope *(based on assignment requirements)*
PROJECT REQUIREMENT: Demonstrate the ability of applying the OOP knowledge in the system design, implement inheritance and polymorphism in the program.
- This Java program features the original arcade game's basic '*Battle and Catch*' mode, catering only 3 PokÃ©mon types (grass, water, fire).
- Some basic features include:
  1. Generating a random set of PokÃ©mon
  2. Displaying PokÃ©mon information
  3. Catching and collecting PokÃ©mon(s) within gameplay
  4. Allowing player to select PokÃ©mon for battle
  5. Allowing player to 'catch' the defeated PokÃ©mon and save it to an external text file
  6. Battle score calculation & displaying a leaderboard

## Concepts Used
- OOP: Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Modularity
- File I/O with the `.txt` files
- Basic game loop & state management
- Simple arithmetic
